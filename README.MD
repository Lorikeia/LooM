# LooM
## (I'm renaming this to LooM for now because I don't like typing out LoDooM.)
Guess who just realized his computer has an FPU! It was me!!

I spent the last week writing an enourmous source port of my own, gutting the original codebase so I could spread my beautiful knowledge through the "modernization" of a 90s game engine. Guess who forgot to stop writing code like it was 1991! It was me, again. You know this already.

And I wasn't even alive for that era, which makes it all the more rare-spu-gos-bhi that I did so. We're in... 2026, for god's sake. So let's write code like it's 2026.

After the drugs wore off, I realized that the code I'd written was fucking disgusting, and worthy of a court case along with lethal injection, so I have banished it to... the same exact folder on my hard drive. -- "Hard Drive", aka not a hard drive.

This time, I'm gonna work on *actually* modernizing the damn thing, and not inadvertanly slowing it DOWN (DOOM reference. Haha. Get it? It kinda looks like DOOM. Alright whatever. I hate you.) by forcing a dead religion into C. Leave that to Terry A. Davis. May he rest... well.

Okay, so what am I doing? Hopefully not this shit. Hopefully I'll have another epiphany and realize I've wasted my time, because cooler people have already done what I dream of doing. I'm gonna be a real productive guy one day, just you wait.

This one is gonna use SDL3!! My last one used SDL1.2. YEEUUUCCKKKK. Let's stop living in 2004 for a moment.

If you look at my code and find that it's pissing you off, please go make an issue and tell me how much of a loser I am for it. (please also tell me why it sucks.)

## Plans.
* SDL3. I just said this. I literally just told you. This oneshould be easy.
* Portals. "WHAT??", you may be asking. That's also me asking. I don't even know how to make them yet.
* This is gonna be 64 bit code, alright? I'm removing m_swap. I'm gonna fucking do it.

## Dependencies (I'm spelling this right.)
* SDL3
* a computer. Put Linux on it. Put Bodhi Linux on it.
* give me a second to get this thing made, man. C'mon.

## Building it.
Go into the (probably still haven't changed this from linuxxdoom) main folder, where you see d_main and all that good stuff. Type "make" into your terminal. Pray that I didn't mess things up. Pray anyways.

## Why'd I Delete the Old One?
I didn't, bro. I already told you this. I'm making THIS one, though, because I need to become a functional human being in roughly one singular day, and remembering where in jah's name I put my events handler isn't going to help me get through college. I'm done with computers after this.

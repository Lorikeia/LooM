This is a log... alright? A normal, ever day log that I WILL be using to keep
track of what the hell it is that I'm doing here. This long will probably not
be forgotton, persay, but I already know that I'm gonna end up neglecting it in
most cases, because who the hell wants to keep an up-to-date log for every
single modification they make in a project where you can leave "//" comments for
(hopefully) future YOU to read?? Absolutely nobody, that's who!

6:14 PM 6-11
Why bother leaving properly formatted & searchable tags? This is MY log! I left
the date and time that I started writing it, so we're good, alright? I'm so
awesome and funny. Everybody loves me. That's what I always say. Tell yourself
that once a day, every day, and you'll end up just like me! Okay, maybe don't do
that... Stick it to the man! Whatever, yo.

Anyways, I've been sitting here waiting for GCC 15.2 to compile so I can finally
get rid of the nasty enum that doom uses as a bool! One problem: it *also* uses
that very same bool as a part of its... lovely structs. That causes some
despicable errors, notably in wad loading, when you change the underlying type
of the boolean. enum, in my case, and probably id Software's too, takes up four
bytes. A nice, shiny bool with stdbool.h, however, usually takes up ONE!! Now,
in some cases, who gives a shit, right? But in SOME cases, like the wad loading,
they specifically needed that four byte wide GURT to make the structs line up. I
hate structs with all of my heart.

Also, once GCC 15.2 is finally ready, probably in five weeks, I might switch
things up to my mortal enemy: c++. I know! I know. Anyways, let's focus on SDL3.

9:25 AM 6-12
Okay! So, I just realized that I obviously need, y'know, the period of time of
day, because we use 12 hour clocks instead of 24. We should start using a
measurement of 0 - 1 to tell us how far we are through the day. "Hey Jordan!
What time is it?". I'd say Jordan's not my name, first of all, but then I'd say
"Oh, it's roughly 0.3923611111!". Okay, maybe not a good idea, but it was worth
a shot.

Anyways, GCC 15.2 has finally finished compiling! I knew because when I checked
my computer this morning, the first thing I saw was "Disk '/dev/mmcblk0p2' usage
is 92 %!" in the top right corner, so I started praying to just about every god
there is, and lo&behold, it was done! Now came time to install... oh my fucking
god, man. I have, like, 300mb left in my storage. Fatass GCC took up everything,
BUT! we can use the cool stuff now!

Also, I got SDL3 implemented last night! Well, the video at least. The audio
comes... some time later.
